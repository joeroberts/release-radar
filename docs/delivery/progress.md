# Release Radar delivery ledger

## Goal

Deliver the signed native macOS MVP described by
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-23-release-radar-mvp.md` on
`codex/release-radar-mvp`, with serialized subagent writes and no pull request.

## Preimplementation gates

| Role | Status | Required findings incorporated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planning | Complete | RR-01 through RR-10 task decomposition and dependencies. |
| Architect | Approved with corrections | Standalone boundary, five lanes, live-Codex feasibility, app-only SQLite authority, sandbox/signing, observer/bridge separation. |
| TPM | Conditional GO satisfied by plan revision | Early persisted board, bounded Codex gate, proportional evidence, autonomous dependency-safe sequence. |
| QA | Approved with acceptance evidence | Five focused service fixtures and one seeded wide/narrow UI flow; no bespoke harness. |
| Delivery Manager | GO | GitHub origin, source-of-truth reconciliation, per-slice ledger updates, and degraded continuation verified. |
| Security/privacy | Conditional pass incorporated | Migration recovery, authenticated IPC, bookmark scope, supported Codex observation, device-only Keychain, minimal Pushover data, atomic outbox. |
