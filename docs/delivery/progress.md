# Release Radar delivery state

## Current outcome

The owner merged [PR #59](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/59) into
`main` at `2f73623`, [PR #60](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/60)
into the Outcome 2 branch at `ac6c440`, [PR #61](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/61)
into the V1 branch at `7defed8`, and corrective [PR #62](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/62)
into `main` at historical integration `f4e77542`. Outcome 2 specifications, Shared
Execution V1 guidance, and the Outcome 3 assessment are integrated into remote
`main`. The [preserved assessment](../design/outcome3-runtime-enforcement-assessment.md)
records the remaining native attachment, pre-turn admission, and persistent
all-tool enforcement gaps. Runtime implementation remains unopened and requires
separate owner authorization.

Main is the sole delegator to the standing Restricted and RO04 coordinators.
Restricted provisions named branches and worktrees, then launches read-write
`rr-project-restricted` workers. RO04 launches `rr-project-ro` independent reviewers
only against candidates and roots assigned by Main. Neither coordinator merges
`main`; all work uses a named branch.

The documentation corrections are integrated through
[PR #63](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/63) and
[PR #64](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/64). The installed-cache
containment security fix is merged through
[PR #65](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/65), release baseline
`89dfc85ad330a30a2ae48d09c7e5252a44ac5111`. Main reported its independent review
and focused native containment tests complete. This restores the helper-local
cache boundary; it does not implement the separate Outcome 3 runtime-enforcement
assessment. Canonical-main state and unrelated work are outside this writer's
ownership and were not changed.

The active local release candidate is **0.1.17 (1)** on
`codex/cache-containment-patch-release`, controlled by the
[release brief](task-briefs/2026-09-15-release-0.1.17/brief.md). Packaging is blocked
by the native Xcode runtime's denied CoreSimulator framework access, including
one supported escalation attempt. Zero release-version tests executed; no
0.1.17 package, tag or installation is complete. The
[candidate evidence](evidence/2026-09-15-release-0.1.17-packaging.md) records the
exact limitation. The installed version remains **0.1.16 (1)**.

Outcome 1 operative-authority reconciliation is complete. The
[completed brief](task-briefs/2026-09-13-operative-authority-reconciliation/operative-authority-reconciliation-brief.md)
records the bounded scope and owner evidence. Operative rules now make accepted
ADRs immutable, direct current specification maintenance to owning mutable designs,
and reconcile the bounded authority wording for ADR-006 and the
usable-project-lifecycle brief without changing their catalog classifications or
any ADR bytes. Publication is tracked in
[PR #58](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/58); GitHub is the source
for its live review and merge state. Outcome 2's delivered specifications, Shared
Execution V1 guidance, and Outcome 3's assessment are integrated into `main`;
Outcome 3 runtime implementation remains unopened.

The installed release is **0.1.16 (1)**. Published tags `v0.1.14`–`v0.1.16`
remain unchanged; `v0.1.16` targets `76cce40cc810d0e8f35af70f05b9d8ea5d884727`.
Releases 0.1.14–0.1.16 are integrated into `main` through
[PR #52](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/52). `main` is GitHub's
default branch. [PR #53](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/53)
removed the unauthorized saved-checkout integration rule.

The RDS search-submit focus correction, consumer adoption and Add Project RDS
styling corrections are complete; their bounded delivery tasks are archived.
The [0.1.16 package evidence](evidence/2026-09-12-release-0.1.16-packaging.md)
records signed identity, matching repository/Downloads DMGs, installation,
layout, focus, accessibility and smoke-launch checks. Existing versioned DMGs
remain the rollback copies.

The owner-approved repository cleanup is complete. Documentation reconciliation
[PR #54](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/54) and the **Stage Release**
action label [PR #56](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/pull/56) are merged
into `main`. Local Git references and disposable build output were cleaned up;
retained work, installers and test evidence were preserved. The
[Historical cleanup closeout](archive/2026-09-11-phase6-delivery-history.md#september-12-repository-cleanup-closeout)
records review limitations and disk recovery. No app release was required.
Current coordination is tracking closeout; no new product implementation is open.

## Current authorization

Main released only the exact worktree
`/Users/jroberts/.codex/worktrees/d7aa/release_radar` and named release branch
from the committed PR #65 baseline for consistent 0.1.17 metadata, scoped local
commits, catalog/index/evidence and ledger correction, native signed packaging,
annotated local tag and standing local non-launch installation. Main arranges
fresh independent read-only metadata/package review and must release installation
after review. The current runtime blocker prevents the package endpoint. No push,
tag push, PR, merge, public release, notarization, app launch, configuration,
database, binding or catalog acceptance is authorized by this assignment.

Outcome 3 assessment work is complete. It does not authorize a local or remote
`main` merge, runtime implementation, configuration, application state, or
publication.

The following paragraph records historical Outcome 1 operative-authority
reconciliation authorization only; it does not authorize present actions. The
current branch-only, no-main-merge rule supersedes it, and no current authority may
be inferred from that historical record.

The owner authorized this repository-only outcome, its controlling brief,
documentation/index changes, independent review, scoped local commits, branch push,
PR creation and merge, and the annotated documentation milestone tag
`docs/operative-authority-reconciliation-2026-09-13` after merge. The delivery
owner owns the branch push and PR creation; the coordinator owns merge and tagging.
Packaging, app release, installation, application launch, binding, catalog
acceptance, evidence mutation and owner data or SQLite access remain excluded.

The owner authorized the documentation reconciliation, local Git/build cleanup,
and the specific Codex action rename, then separately approved both PR merges.
Recording their verified outcomes remains part of delivery coordination.
Application binding/catalog acceptance, evidence mutation and owner SQLite or
project-data changes remain outside that authorization. GitHub protections and
CI are captured for further planning in
[issue #55](https://github.com/joeroberts/release-radar/issues/55); no protection,
workflow or governing-policy change has been approved by that issue.

Earlier owner directions authorize scoped local commits, branch pushes and PRs
for already-authorized delivery work. Earlier Phase 6 local-only publication
restrictions do not revoke those directions or authorize new slices. Every merge
still requires owner approval. Completed authorized app batches retain the
standing local version/tag/DMG/installation workflow in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md);
documentation-only work does not trigger it. GitHub's default branch must not be
changed without an explicit owner request.

Phase 6F metrics remain explicitly stopped. Remaining Phase 6 extensions are
unimplemented and are not opened by this reconciliation. Phase 7 planning is
independently approved at `a0f22d965395248be6ec5928d2932d3a7ce5166d`; implementation
remains paused and both preserved Phase 7 tasks must remain untouched. The approved
[Pursuit reconstruction design](../design/repository-plan-reconstruction-design.md)
remains sequenced after Phase 6H. Proposed guided-setup label 6I does not silently
add another dependency. No live reconstruction is authorized.

## Verification and remaining limitations

For the active 0.1.17 candidate, direct static version/digest assertions,
repository-native documentation checking and `git diff --check` passed.
Focused Xcode tests did not execute because required framework access remained
blocked after one supported escalation. New package/signature/installed-identity
verification and fresh independent release review remain outstanding. The
catalog/index candidate is repository-valid and pending application acceptance;
no managed application readback or synchronization is claimed.

Authority-reconciliation candidate
`f39aae7cf9a2bdfd4adedcd96b1ef73f64014572` passed the repository-native
documentation check, `git diff --check`, focused obsolete-direction searches and
the baseline comparison proving every existing ADR unchanged from
`892b1e11597dd1cff30f04818ecd7dac0605b897`. Independent reviewer task
`01a09b95-5f77-7260-8f06-bccb29143d78` accepted the corrected candidate with no
Required, Optional or Out-of-scope findings. Final catalog/index closeout also
passes repository validation. Chief-architect task
`01a09b8a-1350-7c42-9d14-0aa07f28df40` and reviewer task
`01a09b95-5f77-7260-8f06-bccb29143d78` are archived. The delivery-owner task
remains active only to report this closeout; coordinator archival follows that
stopped result. These checks do not establish application acceptance or
synchronization.

Repository documentation validation passes. The eight completed briefs and their
catalog/index metadata agree; stable artifact identities and evidence remain
preserved. Closed delivery details are in the historical archive. Repository
validation does not establish application acceptance or synchronization.

The previously completed product reviews remain terminal. They do not establish
CodeRabbit review of the remote integrations: PR #52 had no CodeRabbit review or
comment, and PR #53's CodeRabbit review failed because the PR was already closed.
PR #54's final documentation head received an explicit successful CodeRabbit
review. PR #56 was merged on the owner's instruction while CodeRabbit remained
rate-limited; its green status was not a completed review. The
[Historical cleanup closeout](archive/2026-09-11-phase6-delivery-history.md#september-12-repository-cleanup-closeout)
retains the review links and exact outcomes.

The last combined source check recorded **194 passed, 7 skipped, and 6 failed
cases (12 assertions)**. Those failures reproduced on unchanged `5e7b9b8`; this
is not a green full-suite result. Latest consumer-focused verification recorded
3 passing checks and 1 skipped AX-fixture check. These are retained product
results, not new tests performed by this documentation task.

Full owner [manual acceptance](evidence/2026-09-11-phase6-owner-acceptance-guide.md)
remains outstanding. The owner deferred the isolated production stale-helper
scenario to [Phase 8](plans/2026-09-06-full-product-architecture-and-delivery-plan.md#phase-8-deferred-stale-helper-acceptance--owner-decision-2026-09-11).
It remains unpassed: the real stale `SMAppService` upgrade through the installed
Settings button has not been exercised. The
[signed installation evidence](evidence/2026-09-11-restart-helper-signed-installation.md#remaining-stale-helper-gap)
retains the exact limitation. A separately provisioned GUI account or VM remains
future work requiring its own authorization; the owner's live helper must not be
used to manufacture the stale precondition.

The repository cleanup did not perform application inventory, binding/catalog
acceptance or managed readback. The last recorded inventory was `bindingMissing`, `isComplete:false`
for `project-fffdc0e0b15b9b86`; repository checks cannot establish current managed
application synchronization. The changed catalog remains pending application
acceptance; no acceptance has been recorded for this repository correction.

The saved `TEST` search-value diagnosis remains unresolved as to initiator; the
retained audit used only the generic actor. No preference was changed. Details,
prior release checkpoints, review outcomes and task closeouts are preserved in
the [Historical Phase 6 record](archive/2026-09-11-phase6-delivery-history.md#september-12-release-and-integration-checkpoints).

## Next eligible work

Resolve the concrete native Xcode runtime-access blocker, complete focused
release-version verification and signed 0.1.17 packaging, then obtain Main's
fresh independent read-only candidate/package review before installation.
Existing 0.1.16 installation and rollback DMGs remain preserved. This release
assignment does not reopen Outcome 3 or authorize other product work.

Inspect the current application binding/catalog status without changing it, then
present any exact required binding or catalog acceptance mutation for owner
approval. This follow-up is not authorized by the completed outcome 1 task. The
last recorded missing binding must not be treated as fresh
application state or repaired by editing SQLite. Broader owner manual
acceptance remains outstanding under the existing guide. No product slice,
paused task, stopped metrics work, live recovery or Phase 8 environment
provisioning is released by this closeout. GitHub protection/CI planning remains
in issue #55 and is not a prerequisite for these follow-ups.
